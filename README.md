# TetrisPygame

<h3>OK this project is my 2nd game project that i'm created</h3>
<h6>I think you'll who watched this repo are going to know what engine game I used to create this game, so yeah, I used pygame.</h6>
<p>So some features I can't make it, like High Score or Save Your Score. Btw, I think this is actually 80% done. In the future, I will learn and practice my skills more, and I'll come back and get this done. (Date 18 Oct 2022)<p>  
<h6>Now, this game has 2 versions: 1. Dark Edition(Original) and 2. White Edition ðŸ‘‡ LINK IN BELOW ðŸ‘‡</h6>
